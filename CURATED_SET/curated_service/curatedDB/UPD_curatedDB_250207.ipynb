A functional kinetochore interacts with active centromeric chromatin reached with CENP-A to form the mitotic spindle. Human CENP-A plays an important role in stabilization and retention inner kinetochore during G1 phase of cell cycle [pesenti_structure_2022, hoffmann_cenp-is_2016]. However, mitosis can proceed without CENP-A as long as the CENP-B protein remains stably bound to centromeric sequences, facilitating the assembly of the inner kinetochore [hoffmann_cenp-is_2016].',\n",
       " 'localization': 'CENP-A in human chromosomes usually localized in active centromere region within Î±Sat arrays and associated with reduced CpG methylation [altemose_complete_2022, gershman_epigenetic_2022]. Although the centromere position is defined as a window with high CENP-A enrichment (totals 190 to 570 kb on each chromosome), CENP-A was also found near CDRs (centromere dip regions) and no all dips in CpG methylation was associated with CENP-A [altemose_complete_2022]. CENP-A is typically observed in young HOR-haps (although there are a few notable exceptions) [altemose_complete_2022]. Additionally, an analysis of CENP-A enrichment patterns on human chromosome X demonstrated that these patterns exhibit considerable inter-individual variability [altemose_complete_2022].',\n",
       " 'deposition': 'Deposition of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the late telophase/early G1 phase of the cell cycle mediated by four major and some minor factors and regulators, which are important for identifying centromeric localization and limit the process to a single round [pan_mechanism_2019, xu_gross_2023]. The specific CENP-A chaperone HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) plays a key role in stabilizing the binding of CENP-A to histone H4 [foltz_centromere_2009, dunleavy_hjurp_2009, shuaib_hjurp_2010]. To target centromeres and load a new CENP-A HJURP form a stoichiometric complex with the two-subunit Mis18 complex (Mis18Î± and Mis18Î²) and Mis18-binding protein 1 (M18BP1) [hayashi_mis16_2004, pan_mechanism_2019]. Among minor proteins required for CENP-A loading there are RSF1, MgcRacGAP, Condensin II, and KAT7 [pan_mechanism_2019]. Furthermore, loading of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes contributed by CENP-I and CENP-B proteins that are specifically binds to the centromeric DNA. CENP-I, a subunit of the inner kinetochore complex, has been demonstrated to stabilise CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro [hu_cenp-i_2023]. The loss of CENP-B led to a slightly decrease in CENP-A incorporation, though the effect was less pronounced than with HJURP deletion, and a reduction in M18BP1 binding at centromeres assembled with a CENP-A variant without its CENP-C binding domain [fachinetti_dna_2015].',\n",
       " 'interactions': \"CENP-A nucleosomes stabilize the inner kinetochore known as the CCAN complex (Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network) through direct interaction with CENP-C and CENP-N proteins of this complex [cao_constitutive_2018, pesenti_structure_2022, sridhar_kinetochore_2022, xu_gross_2023]. Human CENP-C has been demonstrated to bind with the CENP-A C-terminal hydrophobic tail, the acidic patch of H2A-H2B and histone H4, thereby facilitating its engagement with all four histone subunits present on the nucleosome surface [allu_structure_2019]. The binding of CENP-C to CENP-A is stabilized by the process of phosphorylation of CDK1, which strengthens the complex's structure through the occurrence of an intramolecular interaction, and is critical for long-term viability in human RPE-1 cells [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019, walstein_assembly_2021]. This process is predominantly observed during the M-phase of the cell cycle [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Human CENP-N has been observed to bind to CENP-A nucleosomes through a direct recognition of the L1 loop and RG loop of CENP-A [chittori_structural_2018, tian_molecular_2018, ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. However, cryo-EM studies have revealed that CENP-C and CENP-N bind to a single CENP-A nucleosome in a non-simultaneous manner, thereby demonstrating an asymmetric structure where CENP-C and CENP-N bind to opposite sides of the nucleosome [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Furthermore, in 94% of cases, phosphorylated CENP-C exhibits exclusive binding to the RG-loop of CENP-A, suggesting that this particular interaction is predominant [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. In addition, in vitro reconstruction of the human CENP-C protein showed that CENP-C can bind to two centromeric nucleosomes simultaneously [walstein_assembly_2021].\"}"

The binding of CENP-C to CENP-A is stabilized by the process of phosphorylation of CDK1, which strengthens the complex's structure through the occurrence of an intramolecular interaction, and is critical for long-term viability in human RPE-1 cells [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019, walstein_assembly_2021]. This process is predominantly observed during the M-phase of the cell cycle [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Human CENP-N has been observed to bind to CENP-A nucleosomes through a direct recognition of the L1 loop and RG loop of CENP-A [chittori_structural_2018, tian_molecular_2018, ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. However, cryo-EM studies have revealed that CENP-C and CENP-N bind to a single CENP-A nucleosome in a non-simultaneous manner, thereby demonstrating an asymmetric structure where CENP-C and CENP-N bind to opposite sides of the nucleosome [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Furthermore, in 94% of cases, phosphorylated CENP-C exhibits exclusive binding to the RG-loop of CENP-A, suggesting that this particular interaction is predominant [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. In addition, in vitro reconstruction of the human CENP-C protein showed that CENP-C can bind to two centromeric nucleosomes simultaneously [walstein_assembly_2021].\",\n",

      "UPDATE histone_description SET summary=\"cenH3(Homo_sapiens) is a centromere-specific histone variant in human, often called CENP-A (Centromere Protein A), and an important component of active centromere required for chromosome segregation. For a general description see cenH3(Animals) class.\", knock_out=\"CENP-A depletion at different stages of the cell cycle showed that the earlier CENP-A is removed, the more errors accumulate during later cell divisions [hoffmann_cenp-is_2016].\", function=\"CENP-A nucleosomes are essential for chromosome segregation. A functional kinetochore interacts with active centromeric chromatin reached with CENP-A to form the mitotic spindle. Human CENP-A plays an important role in stabilization and retention inner kinetochore during G1 phase of cell cycle [pesenti_structure_2022, hoffmann_cenp-is_2016]. However, mitosis can proceed without CENP-A as long as the CENP-B protein remains stably bound to centromeric sequences, facilitating the assembly of the inner kinetochore [hoffmann_cenp-is_2016].\", localization=\"CENP-A in human chromosomes usually localized in active centromere region within Î±Sat arrays and associated with reduced CpG methylation [altemose_complete_2022, gershman_epigenetic_2022]. Although the centromere position is defined as a window with high CENP-A enrichment (totals 190 to 570 kb on each chromosome), CENP-A was also found near CDRs (centromere dip regions) and no all dips in CpG methylation was associated with CENP-A [altemose_complete_2022]. CENP-A is typically observed in young HOR-haps (although there are a few notable exceptions) [altemose_complete_2022]. Additionally, an analysis of CENP-A enrichment patterns on human chromosome X demonstrated that these patterns exhibit considerable inter-individual variability [altemose_complete_2022].\", deposition=\"Deposition of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the late telophase/early G1 phase of the cell cycle mediated by four major and some minor factors and regulators, which are important for identifying centromeric localization and limit the process to a single round [pan_mechanism_2019, xu_gross_2023]. The specific CENP-A chaperone HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) plays a key role in stabilizing the binding of CENP-A to histone H4 [foltz_centromere_2009, dunleavy_hjurp_2009, shuaib_hjurp_2010]. To target centromeres and load a new CENP-A HJURP form a stoichiometric complex with the two-subunit Mis18 complex (Mis18Î± and Mis18Î²) and Mis18-binding protein 1 (M18BP1) [hayashi_mis16_2004, pan_mechanism_2019]. Among minor proteins required for CENP-A loading there are RSF1, MgcRacGAP, Condensin II, and KAT7 [pan_mechanism_2019]. Furthermore, loading of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes contributed by CENP-I and CENP-B proteins that are specifically binds to the centromeric DNA. CENP-I, a subunit of the inner kinetochore complex, has been demonstrated to stabilise CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro [hu_cenp-i_2023]. The loss of CENP-B led to a slightly decrease in CENP-A incorporation, though the effect was less pronounced than with HJURP deletion, and a reduction in M18BP1 binding at centromeres assembled with a CENP-A variant without its CENP-C binding domain [fachinetti_dna_2015].\", interactions=\"CENP-A nucleosomes stabilize the inner kinetochore known as the CCAN complex (Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network) through direct interaction with CENP-C and CENP-N proteins of this complex [cao_constitutive_2018, pesenti_structure_2022, sridhar_kinetochore_2022, xu_gross_2023].
