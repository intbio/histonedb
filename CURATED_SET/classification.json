Two H2A-H2B dimers in turn associate with H3-H4 tetramer to form complete nucleosome core. Structure of H2A consists of a histone fold domain extended by a short αC-helix and has both N- and C-terminal tails. αC-helix and C-terminal tail form \"docking domain\" that locks the H2A-H2B dimer onto the surface of H3-H4 tetramer [luger_crystal_1997]. It has been suggested that H2A and H2B have arisen from H3 and H4 during evolution [malik_phylogenomics_2003]",

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2A histone proteins that are expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD) or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2A histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of cH2As during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and scpecies-specific (e.g. cH2A isoforms in human), in other cases there is a whole spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant H2As). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH2A class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclassed.",

Histone genes encodig these proteins have several particular features. 1) These genes lack introns and are found in multiple similar copies clustered along the genome togerther with other core histone genes (H3, H4, H2A, and optionally H1). The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017]. Caveats: 1) Clustered histones may still exhibit some level of sequence variation between the multiple gene copies in certain species. Evidence exists that these differences may have functional implications (e.g. affect nucleosome stability). Some clustered genes have tissue-specific expression and play specific functional roles (e.g. cH2A.1 in mice). 2) A subset of clustered histones, which are normally expressed as replication-dependent histones, are expressed as polyadenylated mRNAs in adult non-dividing tissues to replenish histone pool in differentiated tissues [lyons_subset_2016]. 3) In C. elegans an alternative mechanism of mRNA 3'-end processing evolved resulting in loss of HLB and histone clusters [marzluff_birth_2017, pontarotti_long-term_2009].",
