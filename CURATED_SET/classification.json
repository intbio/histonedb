H2A.B is a rapildy evolving variant which is closely related to H2A.L and H2A.P. It is arginine rich, has a shortened C-terminal tail and docking domain and a smaller acidic patch. It is possible that mouse homolog of H2A.B, also called H2A.Lap1, bears modified function with respect to human H2A.B. H2A.Lap1 has additional negative residue in acidic patch, which is thought to increase its propensity to compact nucleosomal arrays relative to human H2A.B.",
