Two H2A-H2B dimers in turn associate with H3-H4 tetramer to form complete nucleosome core. Structure of H2A consists of a histone fold domain extended by a short αC-helix and has both N- and C-terminal tails. αC-helix and C-terminal tail form \"docking domain\" that locks the H2A-H2B dimer onto the surface of H3-H4 tetramer [luger_crystal_1997].

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2A histone proteins that are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD) or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2A histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of cH2As during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2A isoforms in human), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2As which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH2A class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. ",

Histone genes encodig these proteins have several particular features. 1) These genes lack introns and are found in multiple similar copies clustered along the genome togerther with other core histone genes (H3, H4, H2A, and optionally H1). The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017].",

For a general description see cH2A_(Animals) class. Replication-dependent histones in humans are found in four loci: a large cluster on chromosome 6 (more than 60 genes), two clusters on chromosome 1 (10-12 genes and 4 genes) and a single H4 gene on chromosome 12 (with a neighbouring H2AJ gene). Humans have 18 H2A genes that code for replication-dependent H2A histones. The cluster on chromosome 6 encodes 13 H2A genes (H2AC1, H2AC4, H2AC6, H2AC7, H2AC8, H2AC11, H2AC12, H2AC13, H2AC14, H2AC15, H2AC16, H2AC17) and several pseudogenes. The first cluster on chromosome 1 encodes 4 genes (H2AC18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21), and the second cluster on chromosome 1 endodes one gene (H2AC25). 18 genes enconde 11 protein variants. H2A18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21 encode isoforms that have a methionine instead of leucine at position 51 conferring a mobility shift in triton-acid urea gel electrophoresis (historically, H2A.2 symbol was used to mark this difference) [franklin_non-allelic_1977]. H2AC1 gene (formely, called HIST1H2AA, TH2A) is the most divergent gene of the family, together with H2BC1 they share a common promoter and maifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) [huynh_two_2016].",

In humans, H2A.X produces both polyadenylated mRNAs and mRNAs ending on a stem-loop. It is probale that it is ancestral to clustered H2A histones [talbert_histone_2021]. 3) The H2AJ gene on chromosome 12 encoding H2A.J histone variant is sequence wise very similar to other canonical H2As in human. However, it appears to produce only polyadenylated mRNA. See H2A.J variant description for details."

This histone variant is essential from Tetrahymena to mammals (although its knock out in yeast is not lethal) and amounts to around 5-10% of H2A histones [dalmasso_canonical_2011]. H2A.Z containing nucleosomes often localize near transcription start sites (+1 nucleosomes) and enhancer regions, they are thought to be involved in Pol II recruitment, transcription regulation, DNA repair, suppression of antisense RNA, heterochromatin regulation.  [giaimo_histone_2019]. H2A.Z nucleosomes have a larger acidic patch, an amino acid insertion in α1-helix and one deletion in the docking domain compared to the canonical H2A. The L1-loop region exhibits four amino acids difference between H2A.Z and canonical H2A and is likely involved in conferring stability and functional specificity of variant nucleosomes via L1-L1 interactions [shaytan_nucleosome_2015]. C-terminal region of the yeast H2A.Z protein interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), promoting its recruitment at promoters [adam_h2az_2001]."},

        "description": {"summary":"H2A.L - is a class of short H2A variants in eutherian mammals implicated in spermatogenesis and replacement of histones with protamines. Genes: Сommon ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded three H2A.L genes. These genes are usually located on X chromosome at three locations (named H2A.L.1, H2A.L.2 and H2A.L.3 by Molaro et al.) [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Humans have two putative genes (H2AL1Q, H2AL3, located at H2A.L.1 and H2A.L.3 loci, respectively) and H2AL1MP pseudogene (located at H2A.L.2 loci has inactivating mutation in all primates). The H2AL1Q and H2AL3 genes have unusually long extensions at their 3'-ends and have not so far been detected at protein level. Mouse genome has a leneage specific expansion of H2A.L genes, encoding a total of 18 genes (15 genes on X chromosome H2a1a-H2a1o and H2al3; two genes on Y-chromosome H2al2c and H2al2b; one gene on chromosome 2 H2al2a) and two pseudogenes [molaro_evolutionary_2018].  At H2A.L.1 locus mouse has a pseudogene H2al1q-ps. The most studied gene in mice is H2al2a. This gene was first identified in [govin_pericentric_2007] (NCBI protein id NP_080903) and was refered to as H2AL2 or H2A.L.2 histone in the following papers. However, this gene is not located at the H2A.L.2 locus (as defined by Molaro et al.) on X-chromosome, but it is rather located on chromosome 2. A synthenic location of H2A.L.2 locus in mouse is occupied by H2al1m gene [Seal et al. unpublished]. Previous names for mouse H2A.Ls include H2A.Lap2, H2A.Lap3, H2A.Lap4, H2AL1, H2AL2 [soboleva_unique_2011, govin_pericentric_2007]. H2AL1 has been used to reffer to H2al1a gene [govin_pericentric_2007]. Evolution: Molaro et al. found that short H2A variants show greater evolutionary divergence between species than even CENPA, the fastest-evolving histone variant examined to date [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Evolutionary analysis of purifying selection suggested that H2A.L function may have been lost in Old World monkeys and hominoids but retained in New World monkeys [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Knock-out: H2A.L.2 knock out mice are infertile because transition proteins can no longer associate with chromatin [barral_histone_2017]. Function: Required for the histone–protamine exchange process [barral_histone_2017]. Sequence: Sequence is divergent from cH2A. Identity with cH2A may be as low as 30%. H2A.L variants have a shortened C-termus, truncated docking domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus. Nucleosomes incorporating H2A.L warp less DNA and from more loosely packed chromatin [molaro_evolutionary_2018].  Localization: Accumulates in spermatid nuclei until the end of spermatogenesis and remains in mature sperm chromatin even after protamine exchange in mouse, eventually disappearing from the paternal pronucleus following fertilization [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Involved in pericentric chromatin organization in spermatids, is retained after histone-to-protamine replacement [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. H2A.L.2 is maximally expressed at later stages of spermatogenesis (condensing spermatids) when histones are bound by transition proteins and then replaced with protamines Structural effects: Interactions: H2A.L.2 preferentially dimerizes with H2B.1 (TH2B) at least in mice [govin_pericentric_2007]. Intranuclear localization of H2A.L.2 is controlled by its ability to bind RNA via its N-terminus [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. Deposition: Likely mediated by interaction with RNA [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. Disease: no information, since no H2A.L have been so far detect at protein level in humans. Caveats: there is some confusion in literature with respect to numbering H2A.L subvariants, especially in mouse (see caveats in description of mouse H2A.L variants)."},

The single autosomal H2al2a (H2A.L.2 variant) gene in mouse located on chromosome 2 is expressed at much higher levels than the sex-linked copies; knockout of this single gene is sufficient to cause male sterility [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. See H2A.L description for more information. Caveats: there is some confusion with the variant names in the literature. Govin et al. initially identified and named three variants H2AL1, H2AL2, H2AL3 [govin_pericentric_2007]. These are encoded by H2al1a, H2al2a and H2ap genes, respectively. The H2Al2 endoded variant was later renamed in the literature as H2A.L.2 [jiang_short_2020]. The H2ap gencoded variant is in fact H2A.P in the current nomenclature. Alternatively, Molaro et al. have named three evolutionary conserved loci on X chromosome that harbor H2A.L genes, these loci are H2A.L.1, H2A.L.2 and H2A.L.3 [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. While human gene and variant naming is in line with the names of these loci, in mouse names of these loci do not correspond exactly to the originally proposed gene names except for H2A.L.3 locus which harbors H2al3 gene (not H2ap gene(!)). In mouse at H2A.L.1 locus a pseudogene H2al1q-ps is located, at H2A.L.2 locus mouse has H2al1m gene (H2al1a-H2al1o genes located within 5 megabases from this locus have similar protein sequences(?)), while H2A.L.2 variant encoded by H2al2a is located on chromosome 2 (two similar genes H2al2b and H2al2c are located on Y chromosome). In this classification we follow the numbering used in gene names which also corresponds to the one established earlier in the literature. Hence, H2A.L.2 variant in mouse encompasses H2al2a gene and similar H2al2b and H2al2c genes, while H2A.L.1 variant encompasses 14 H2al1a-H2al1o genes including H2al1m gene located at a syntenic location of the H2A.L.2 locus"},

Its expression in mouse has been shown only at mRNA level [el_kennani_ms_histonedb_2017], although evolutionary analysis strongly argues that it is a protein coding gene [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. In human H2A.P gene H2ap was previously named HYPM (Huntingtin-interacting protein M) since in yeast two-hybrid experiments it was shown to interact with huntingtin, which contains an expanded polyglutamine tract in individuals with Huntington's disease [faber_huntingtin_1998]. Genes: Сommon ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded a single H2A.P gene. These genes are usually located on X chromosome as do other short H2As [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Humans and mouse have one gene name H2AP and H2ap, respectively. Evolution: Molaro et al. found that short H2A variants show greater evolutionary divergence between species than even CENPA, the fastest-evolving histone variant examined to date. Their results indicate that H2A.P and possible H2A.B have been subject to diversifying selection in simian primates, which could partly ecplame the greater divergence of short H2A histone variants compared to other H2A histones in mammals [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Knock-out: no studies. Function: no specific studies have been reported, but by its similarity to H2A.L it is likely that it participates in the histone–protamine exchange process. Sequence: Has one of the most divergent sequences from cH2A. Identity with cH2A may be as low as 24%. H2A.P variants have a shortened C-termus, truncated docking domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus. H2A.P have lost two key conserved arginine (R) residues in Loop 1 and 2 that contact the DNA minor-groove and acquired many acidic residues at sites including contacts with DNA and H2B. The last 14 residues in H2A.P are more evolutionary contrained than the rest of the protein, suggesting their potential interaction with non-histone proteins.

It was characterized in human and mouse, similar genes are present in other mammals. It has been implicated in cell senesecence. Genes: In human it is encoded by H2AJ gene on chormomosome 12, in mouse by H2aj gene on chromosome 6. Both genes are intronless. H2aj gene lacks a stem-loop structure at the 3'-UTR but contains a poly (A) signal [nishida_novel_2005]. Similar genes are found in other mammals [contrepois_histone_2017]. Evolution: no studies available. Knock-out: Depletion of H2A.J via RNA interference modifies senesecence-associated chromatin re-structuring and abolishes senesecence-associated secretory phenotype in human fibroblasts subject to ionizing radiation [isermann_histone_2020]. Function, disease: It has been shown that H2A.J accumulates in senescent cells and promotes inflammatory gene expression [isermann_histone_2020,contrepois_histone_2017]. Sequence: It differs from canonical H2A protein sequences only by an A11V substitution and the presence of an SQK motif near the C-terminus, which is a potential phosphorylation site [talbert_histone_2021]. Localization: In fibroblast irradiation experiments it was shown that H2A.J colocalizes with 53BP1 and is incorporated at the periphery of so-called senesecence-associated chromatin foci (SAHF) [isermann_histone_2020]. Deposition: unclear. Structural effects: sequence changes lie only within the histone tails, alterations to the C-terminal tail may theoretically alter interactions with linker DNA and H1-histone, but this has not been studied. Interactions: colocalizes with 53BP1 [isermann_histone_2020]."},

Like cH2A, this is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2B histone proteins that are expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD) or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2B histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of cH2Bs during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2B.E isoforms in mouse), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2Bs which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case.

See also description of cH2B.1_(Mus_musculus) -- a related histone variant encoded by H2bc1 gene which has been characterized through a number of in vivo and in vitro studies. Phylogenetic analysis of cH2B.1 in mammals by Raman et al. suggests that when considered together with its N-terminal tail histones form a distinct phylogenetic clade with high bootstrap support [raman_novel_2022].",

This is the most divergent gene of the family, its protein product has differences in INSERT HERE. Together with H2ac1 gene they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis, oocytes and zygotes) [padavattan_structural_2015]. Disruption of Th2a and Th2b genes causes defects in spermatogenesis [shinagawa_disruption_2015]. H2ac1 and H2bc1 contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization [shinagawa_histone_2014]. These variant facilitate OSKM-induced cell reprogramming [shinagawa_histone_2014].  X-ray structure of nucleosome harboring this variant have fewer histone-DNA contacts and perturbed L1-L1-loop interactions. Mutational in vivo analysis suggest histone tails and L1 loop of cH2A.1 are important for reprogramming [padavattan_structural_2015]. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that the H2ac1/H2bc1 complex was more stable than other combinations of canonical histones [shinagawa_histone_2014]. This variant is related to cH2B.1_(Homo_sapiens) encoded by H2B1C gene, is located in the same position at the largest histone gene cluster, however, their sequence differs at INSERT HERE positions. Structural and in vitro studies suggest that cH2B.1-containing nucleosomes are less stable than RC H2B, which may allow H2B.1 to facilitate histone-protamine exchange during spermatogenesis. More recently, H2B.1 has also been detected in mouse oocytes, where its function is not yet understood [raman_novel_2022]. Note: Since this variant manifests similar features in mice and humans (tissue-specific expression, synteny, divergent sequence with respect to other canonical variants in each species) likely similar variants exist in all supraprimates or in higher taxa. Once and if sufficient evidence accumulates such variants may be grouped into a separate class.",

Currently, this is a loosely defined group of replication-dependent H2B histones in plants together with similar sequences that might have further diversified towards replication-independent tissue-specific expression but have not yet been extensively studied. An example of the latter would be the HTB3 gene of Arabidopsis which has the hallmarks of a replacement histone variant enriched in mature cells [jiang_evolution_2020]. Organisation of canonical histones in green plants is variable. In land plants unlike clustered/canonical histones of animals (see cH2B_(Metazoa)) replication dependent histone mRNAs are polyadenilated and genes are interspersed throught the genome. In chlorophyte green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, genes are grouped in clusteres and mRNAs end in 3'-stem loop similar to those of histone genes in animals [marzluff_metabolism_2008, alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Plant H2Bs vary substantially in the length and sequence of their N-terminal tails [jiang_evolution_2020,bergmuller_characterization_2007]. A study of evolution and functional divergence of H2B histones in plants by Jiang et al. concluded that amongst flowering plants, eudicots had experienced the highest degree of divergence among H2B genes [jiang_evolution_2020]. This divergence appears to have been driven by preferential expression during gametogenesis, including three genes in Arabidopsis (HTB7/8/10 genes) and at least one in tomato. While HTB8 gene in Arabidopsis belongs to a phylogenetically distinct H2B.S variant [jiang_evolution_2020], HTB7 and HTB10 are much more similar in sequence to other H2Bs for now are included as cH2B in our classification [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].",

SAL-PT resides within in the layer of condensed cytosol between acrosome and the nucleus of the spermatid [tran_involvement_2012]. N-terminal tail of subH2Bv contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bNLS) [tran_involvement_2012]. A study be Tran et al. suggested that this bNLS allows subH2Bv during spermiogenesis to target proacrosomic and acrosomic vesicles to the nuclear envelope by binding to the nucleocytoplasmic receptor KPNA [tran_involvement_2012]. In mouse Govin et al. have identified a homologous protein, which was named H2BL1, which was shown to accumalate in late spermiogenesis in condensing spermatids [govin_pericentric_2007]. Although when expressed ectopically fused with EGPFP the protein enters cell nucleus, it is has not been seen developmentally within the nucleus of the spermatid [tran_involvement_2012].
