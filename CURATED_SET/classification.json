Two H2A-H2B dimers in turn associate with H3-H4 tetramer to form complete nucleosome core. Structure of H2A consists of a histone fold domain extended by a short αC-helix and has both N- and C-terminal tails. αC-helix and C-terminal tail form \"docking domain\" that locks the H2A-H2B dimer onto the surface of H3-H4 tetramer [luger_crystal_1997]. It has been suggested that H2A and H2B have arisen from H3 and H4 during evolution [malik_phylogenomics_2003]",

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2A histone proteins that are expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD) or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2A histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of cH2As during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and scpecies-specific (e.g. cH2A isoforms in human), in other cases there is a whole spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant H2As). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH2A class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. Caveats: [dalmasso_canonical_2011].",

Histone genes encodig these proteins have several particular features. 1) These genes lack introns and are found in multiple similar copies clustered along the genome togerther with other core histone genes (H3, H4, H2A, and optionally H1). The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017]. Caveats: 1) Clustered histones may still exhibit some level of sequence variation between the multiple gene copies in certain species. Evidence exists that these differences may have functional implications (e.g. affect nucleosome stability). Some clustered genes have tissue-specific expression and play specific functional roles (e.g. cH2A.1 in mice). 2) A subset of clustered histones, which are normally expressed as replication-dependent histones, are expressed as polyadenylated mRNAs in adult non-dividing tissues to replenish histone pool in differentiated tissues [lyons_subset_2016]. 3) In C. elegans an alternative mechanism of mRNA 3'-end processing evolved resulting in loss of HLB and histone clusters [marzluff_birth_2017, pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 4) H2A.X histone variant is usually closely related to replication-dependent H2A histones in the same group of animals. In humans, H2A.X produces both polyadenylated mRNAs and mRNAs ending on a stem-loop. It is probale that it is ancestral to clustered H2A histones [talbert_histone_2021].",

For a general description see cH2A_(Animals) class. Replication-dependent histones in humans are found in four loci: a large cluster on chromosome 6 (more than 60 genes), two clusters on chromosome 6 (10-12 genes and 4 genes) and a single H4 gene on chromosome 12. Humans have 18 H2A genes that code for replication-dependent H2A histones. The cluster on chromosome 6 encodes 13 H2A genes (H2AC1, H2AC4, H2AC6, H2AC7, H2AC8, H2AC11, H2AC12, H2AC13, H2AC14, H2AC15, H2AC16, H2AC17) and several pseudogenes. The first cluster on chromosome 1 encodes 4 genes (H2AC18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21), and the second cluster on chromosome 1 endodes one gene (H2AC25). 18 genes enconde 11 protein variants. H2A18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21 encode isoforms that have a methionine instead of leucine at position 51 conferring a mobility shift in triton-acid urea gel electrophoresis (historically, H2A.2 symbol was used to mark this difference) [franklin_non-allelic_1977]. H2AC1 gene (formely, called HIST1H2AA, TH2A) is the most divergent gene of the family, together with H2BC1 they share a common promoter and maifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) [huynh_two_2016].

This is the most divergent gene of the family, its protein product has differences in the ?last 6 amino acids? at the C-terminus with respect to the majority of clustered H2As???. Together with H2bc1 gene they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis, oocytes and zygotes) [padavattan_structural_2015]. Disruption of Th2a and Th2b genes causes defects in spermatogenesis [shinagawa_disruption_2015]. H2ac1 and H2ab1 contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization [shinagawa_histone_2014]. These variant facilitate OSKM-induced cell reprogramming [shinagawa_histone_2014].  X-ray structure of nucleosome harboring this variant have fewer histone-DNA contacts and perturbed L1-L1-loop interactions. Mutational in vivo analysis suggest histone tails and L1 loop are important for reprogramming[padavattan_structural_2015]. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that the H2ac1/H2ab1 complex was more stable than other combinations of canonical histones [shinagawa_histone_2014]. This variant is related to cH2A.1_(Homo_sapiens) encoded by H2A1C gene, is located in the same position at the largest histone gene cluster, however, their sequence differes at 18 positions. Note: Since this variant manifests similar features in mice and humans (tissue-specific expression, synteny, divergent sequnce with respect to other canonical variants in each species) likely similar variants exist in all supraprimates or in higher taxa.

Human and mouse have three genes encoding H2A.Bs [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Evolution: H2A.B is a rapildy evolving variant which is closely related to H2A.L, H2A.P, H2A.Q [molaro_evolutionary_2018].

Sequence: Around 50% identity with the canonical H2A, has truncated docking domain, divergent histone fold domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Localization: H2A.B is expressed during mammalian male germ cell development and in the brain [molaro_evolutionary_2018,jiang_short_2020]. Originally, H2A.B  was characterized by its exclusion from the inactive X chromosome if overexpressed in female somatic cells [chadwick_novel_2001]. However, experiments in mouse testis revealed that H2A.B is in fact present on the inactive X chromosome  [soboleva_unique_2011].

This histone variant can bind to RNA directly in vitro and in vivo, and associates with mRNA at intron—exon boundaries [soboleva_new_2017]. Structural effects: H2A.B containing nucleosomes wrap less DNA (~120-130 bp instead of ~150 bp) [sugiyama_distinct_2014,doyen_dissection_2006], form loosely packed chromatin. Interactions: RNA processing factors, proteins involved in the piRNA pathway [jiang_short_2020]  Deposition: It was suggested that H2A.B is incorporated into DNA sites that are transiently exposed, for instance, during DNA relication [jiang_short_2020]. H2A.B-H2A dimers in nuclesomes can sontaneously be replaced by H2A-H2B dimers [hirano_histone_2021]. Disease: H2A.B is upregulated in cancer as other short H2A variants [chew_short_2021]. Caveats: Due to rapid evolution H2A.B function in different species may vary. For example, human H2A.B is retained during spermiogenesis, while is mouse it dissappers and H2A.L is retained instead [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Mouse H2A.B has additional negative residue in acidic patch, which is thought to increase its propensity to compact nucleosomal arrays relative to human H2A.B.",

They are involved in spermiogenesis, transcription regulation, splicing, DNA synthesis. Genes: In human H2A.B is encoded by H2AB1, H2AB2 and H2AB3 genes. Genes are intronless. H2AB2 and H2AB3 encode identical proteins. H2AB1 a protein which differes by ??one?? amino acid. Genes are located on X chromosome. Evolution: H2A.B is a rapildy evolving variant which is closely related to H2A.L, H2A.P, H2A.Q [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Common ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded two or three H2A.B genes. Knock-out: H2A.B knock-out mice are viable, subfertile and display changes in splicing events [anuar_gene_2019]. Sequence: Around 50% identity with the canonical H2A, has truncated docking domain, divergent histone fold domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Localization: H2A.B is expressed during mammalian male germ cell development and in the brain [molaro_evolutionary_2018,jiang_short_2020]. Originally, H2A.B  was characterized by its exclusion from the inactive X chromosome if overexpressed in female somatic cells [chadwick_novel_2001].
