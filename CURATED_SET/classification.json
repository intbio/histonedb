These histones act as \"capstones\", thereby limiting DNA compactization and regulating genome accessibility. It is noteworthy that capstones are evolutionarily conserved and have arisen independently in different lineages of archaea, which underscores their significance in chromatin organisation, akin to functional variants of histones in eukaryotes [stevens_histone_2020].",

It has been demonstrated that CenH3 has undergone adaptive evolution at a significantly higher frequency in clades with asymmetric meiosis compared to those with symmetric meiosis [zedek_cenh3_2016]. This finding is in accordance with the predictions of the centromere drive model. Furthermore, the occurrence of more frequent adaptive changes in CenH3 is necessary to offset the negative effects of centromere drive [zedek_cenh3_2016].",

For example, the deep evolutionary conservation of cenH3 histone function in plants demonstarted by the ability of Zea mays cenH3 to functionally replace its counterpart in Arabidopsis thaliana [maheshwari_naturally_2015]. However, certain functional differences of cenH3 in chromosome segregation are observed across different species [wong_epigenetic_2020, steiner_diversity_2015]. Distinction is mainly related to cenH3 distribution on the chromosome, timing of cenH3 replenishment, heterochromatin dependence and chaperone specificity. In most mammals (including humans), cenH3 is incorporated into nucleosomes positioned within satellite repeat regions. In contrast, yeast species exhibit both regional (fission yeast) and point (budding yeast) centromeres, the latter consisting of a single cenH3 nucleosome complex assembled on specific DNA sequences. Nematode holocentromeres are characterized by the distribution of cenH3 along the entire chromosome length. Key factors of centromere identity in speicies with regional centromere (e.g., vertebrates) are the epigenetic context and transcription of centromeric DNA, whereas centromeres in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) are determined by specific DNA sequences [wong_epigenetic_2020, hara_critical_2017, hori_histone_2014]. Moreover, studies in human and chicken cells have demonstrated the existence of natural and artificially created functional neocentromeres lacking alpha-satellite DNA [hara_critical_2017]. At the same time, despite the possibility of epigenetic drift, cenH3 positioning in maize centromeres is stable over generations and primarily governed by genetic changes [gent_stable_2015].",

                "localization": "null",
                "deposition": "Unlike canonical histones, cenH3 deposition is replication-independent. In most speices, cenH3 synthesis and loading occurs during late mitosis and G1 phase of the cell cycle, mediated by specialized chaperones (HJURP in humans, Scm3 in budding and fission yeast, and CAL1 in Drosophila). However, the timing of deposition differs in some organisms. For instance, in budding yeast, cenH3 replenishment occurs during S-phase [wong_epigenetic_2020, pearson_stable_2004]. Notably, both budding yeast and nematodes (C. elegans) exhibit complete turnover of cenH3 each cell cycle [wong_epigenetic_2020]. The assembly and replenishment of cenH3 nucleosomes involves chromatin remodeling, resulting in the displacement of H3.3 histones and active stabilization by specific proteins (e.g., HJURP, CENP-C, CENP-B in humans) [dunleavy_h33_2011, wong_epigenetic_2020, black_epigenetic_2011]. It is possible that new cenH3 deposition doesn't always occur at the same centromeric position during every cell cycle [dunleavy_h33_2011]. Deposition of cenH3 into centromeric nucleosomes depends not only on a specific chaperone but also on numerous other factors. The study using DT40 (chicken) and HeLa S3 (human) cell lines demonstrated that chromatin-remodeling complexes FACT and CHD1 play important roles in the proper recruitment of cenH3 [okada_cenp-hcontaining_2009]. However, this observation is likely not universal across all organisms. For example, in Drosophila, cenH3 incorporation occurs independently of CHD1, yet still involves direct participation of FACT [podhraski_cenh3cid_2010, chen_establishment_2015, chen_cal1_2014].",

For example, in vertebrates, CENP-A is concentrated in a compact centromeric region, whereas in nematodes, HCP-3 is distributed diffusely, corresponding to a holocentric organization [hara_critical_2017]. Notably, in certain holocentric organisms, cenH3 appears dispensable for meiotic chromosome segregation while remaining essential for mitosis. As demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans, cenH3 loading is specifically eliminated following meiosis I, and RNAi-mediated depletion of CENP-A during meiosis fails to disrupt proper chromosome segregation [monen_differential_2005]. This stands in striking contrast to mitotic divisions, where cenH3 is absolutely required for kinetochore assembly and faithful chromosome segregation. Moreover, C. elegans and C. remanei possess a second cenH3 histone gene that likely performs specialized functions distinct from canonical cenH3 roles [monen_separase_2015].

CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of CENP-C enhances its binding to CENP-A nucleosomes during mitosis, as shown in both chicken and human cells [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019]. However, the functional importance of this interaction varies: while it is nonessential for viability in chicken cells, it is crucial for proper CENP-C kinetochore localization and long-term survival in human cells [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019]. It was demonstrated that binding of the CENP-C protein stiffens the cenH3 nucleosome, decreasing its flexibility and stabilizing its conformation, which promotes chromatin condensation and restricts access for transcriptional machinery [melters_intrinsic_2019]. CENP-N specifically recognizes CENP-A in the centromeric nucleosome by binding to its L1 loop through key residues (e.g., E3, T4, E7 in humans) and stabilizes the interaction via electrostatic contacts with nucleosomal DNA [chittori_structural_2018].

Human CENP-A plays an important role in stabilization and retention inner kinetochore during G1 phase of cell cycle [pesenti_structure_2022, hoffmann_cenp-is_2016]. However, mitosis can proceed without CENP-A as long as the CENP-B protein remains stably bound to centromeric sequences, facilitating the assembly of the inner kinetochore [hoffmann_cenp-is_2016].",

During the cell cycle, K124 undergoes cyclic modifications [bui_internal_2017]. In G1/S phase, K124ac compacts the nucleosome, interfering with CENP-C binding (crucial for kinetochore assembly) while simultaneously promoting chromatin decondensation for centromere replication [bui_internal_2017]. During S phase, K124me stabilizes nucleosomes. Furthermore, K124 mutations disrupt both mitosis and replication, demonstrating its critical role in centromere epigenetic regulation [bui_internal_2017].",

Although the centromere position is defined as a window with high CENP-A enrichment (totals 190 to 570 kb on each chromosome), CENP-A was also found near CDRs (centromere dip regions) and no all dips in CpG methylation was associated with CENP-A [altemose_complete_2022]. CENP-A is typically observed in young HOR-haps (although there are a few notable exceptions) [altemose_complete_2022]. Additionally, an analysis of CENP-A enrichment patterns on human chromosome X demonstrated that these patterns exhibit considerable inter-individual variability [altemose_complete_2022].",
                "deposition": "Deposition of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the late telophase/early G1 phase of the cell cycle mediated by four major and some minor factors and regulators, which are important for identifying centromeric localization and limit the process to a single round [pan_mechanism_2019, xu_gross_2023]. The specific CENP-A chaperone HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein) plays a key role in stabilizing the binding of CENP-A to histone H4 [foltz_centromere_2009, dunleavy_hjurp_2009, shuaib_hjurp_2010]. To target centromeres and load a new CENP-A HJURP form a stoichiometric complex with the two-subunit Mis18 complex (Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2) and Mis18-binding protein 1 (M18BP1) [hayashi_mis16_2004, pan_mechanism_2019]. Among minor proteins required for CENP-A loading there are RSF1, MgcRacGAP, Condensin II, and KAT7 [pan_mechanism_2019]. Furthermore, loading of CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes contributed by CENP-I and CENP-B proteins that are specifically binds to the centromeric DNA. CENP-I, a subunit of the inner kinetochore complex, has been demonstrated to stabilise CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro [hu_cenp-i_2023]. The loss of CENP-B led to a slightly decrease in CENP-A incorporation, though the effect was less pronounced than with HJURP deletion, and a reduction in M18BP1 binding at centromeres assembled with a CENP-A variant without its CENP-C binding domain [fachinetti_dna_2015]. Notably, in contrast to maintenance, de novo centromere formation (e.g., neocentromere establishment) depends on HJURP-mediated recruitment of CENP-C [tachiwana_hjurp_2015]. The deposition of CENP-A depends not only on protein factors but also on the characteristics of alpha-satellite DNA. CENP-B boxes stabilize CENP-A nucleosomes through interaction with the CENP-B protein [mcnulty_alpha_2018]. During early G1 phase, RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of alpha-satellite DNA generates non-coding RNAs that facilitate recruitment of the CENP-A/HJURP complex [mcnulty_alpha_2018]. Furthermore, post-translational histone modifications (H3K4me2, H3K36me2, H3K9ac, H4K16ac) establish a permissive chromatin environment and prevent heterochromatin spreading [mcnulty_alpha_2018].",
                "structure": "CENP-A confers enhanced flexibility and elasticity to nucleosomes, influencing centromeric chromatin organization and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis [fedulova_molecular_2024, pitman_minimal_2020, melters_intrinsic_2019, tachiwana_crystal_2011]. Partial nucleosome unwrapping in CENP-A-containing nucleosomes is promoted by its shortened \u03b1N-helix [roulland_flexible_2016]. Cryo-EM analysis of human CENP-A nucleosomes revealed asymmetric DNA end flexibility, with the right DNA end being highly dynamic and partially detached from the histone core while the left end remained stably bound, a sequence-dependent behavior confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations [kono_free_2019, boopathi_phase-plate_2020]. Notably, this intrinsic asymmetry can be overcome by antibody stabilization. The single-chain antibody fragment PL2-6 symmetrically stabilizes both DNA ends through allosteric interactions, despite the inherent sequence-dependent asymmetry [zhou_atomic_2019, dogan_cenp-nucleosome_2021]. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that CENP-A-containing tetramers exhibit enhanced stability but distinct dynamics compared to canonical octameric structures, explaining the unusual properties of CENP-A nucleosomes [zhao_oligomerization_2019].",
                "interactions": "CENP-A nucleosomes stabilize the inner kinetochore known as the CCAN complex (Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network) through direct interaction with CENP-C and CENP-N proteins of this complex [cao_constitutive_2018, pesenti_structure_2022, sridhar_kinetochore_2022, xu_gross_2023]. Human CENP-C has been demonstrated to bind with the CENP-A C-terminal hydrophobic tail, the acidic patch of H2A-H2B and histone H4, thereby facilitating its engagement with all four histone subunits present on the nucleosome surface [allu_structure_2019]. The binding of CENP-C to CENP-A is critical for long-term viability in human RPE-1 cells [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019]. This interaction is stabilized by the process of CENP-C phosphorylation mediated by CDK1, which strengthens the complex's structure through the occurrence of an intramolecular interaction [watanabe_cdk1-mediated_2019, walstein_assembly_2021, ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Human CENP-N has been observed to bind to CENP-A nucleosomes through a direct recognition of the L1 loop and RG loop of CENP-A [chittori_structural_2018, tian_molecular_2018, ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. However, cryo-EM studies have revealed that CENP-C and CENP-N bind to a single CENP-A nucleosome in a non-simultaneous manner, thereby demonstrating an asymmetric structure where CENP-C and CENP-N bind to opposite sides of the nucleosome [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. Furthermore, in 94% of cases, phosphorylated CENP-C exhibits exclusive binding to the RG-loop of CENP-A, suggesting that this particular interaction is predominant [ariyoshi_cryoem_2021]. In addition, in vitro reconstruction of the human CENP-C protein showed that CENP-C can bind to two centromeric nucleosomes simultaneously [walstein_assembly_2021]. Nevertheless, interactions with CENP-C or CENP-N do not determine the stability of CENP-A nucleosomes in chromatin [cao_constitutive_2018].",

It was demonstrated that the duplication of HTR12 in A. lyrata may have facilitated adaptation to multiple centromeric satellite sequences, though the underlying mechanisms of this process require further investigation [kawabe_duplication_2006]. Pisum and closely related Lathyrus species also retain two CenH3 paralogs (CenH3-1 and CenH3-2) originating from a Fabeae ancestor [neumann_centromeres_2015, neumann_stretching_2012]. Despite divergence, they colocalize in centromeres, likely enabling meta-polycentric organization with multiple functional domains. CenH3-2 is highly conserved but shows adaptive evolution in its histone fold, while CenH3-1 is more variable (especially N-terminal) without signs of positive selection [neumann_centromeres_2015]. The diploid barley species H. vulgare and H. bulbosum each encode two functional CENH3 variants (\u03b1 and \u03b2) that arose before their divergence (~7 mya), are expressed and incorporated into centromeres, but display distinct interspecific incorporation patterns in hybrids [sanei_loss_2011, karimi-ashtiyani_point_2015]. Notably, in early embryos, some centromeres (9.6%) contain only \u03b2CENH3, while later stages always incorporate both variants, revealing developmental-stage-specific loading [ishii_differential_2015]. In rye, both CENH3 genes (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are actively transcribed, retained in the genome, and likely functionally important for centromeric nucleosome assembly, while alternative splicing of \u03b1CENH3 generates protein diversity without affecting key DNA-binding domains (CATD) [evtushenko_conserved_2017].",

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2A histone proteins that are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD), replication coupled (RC), clustered or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2A histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003], although a similar H2A.X variant might have been also ancestral [talbert_histone_2021]. Expression of canonical histones during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. Canonical histone genes are often present as large mulrigene families clustered together in certain locations of the genome. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution  in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2A isoforms in human), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2As which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH2A class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. ",

                "summary": "cH2A.1_(Mus_musculus)  is an isoform (variant) of clustered (canonical) H2A histones in mouse endoded by H2ac1 gene (formerly, Hist1h2aa, Th2a). This is the most divergent gene of the family, its protein product has differences in the ?last 6 amino acids? at the C-terminus with respect to the majority of clustered H2As???. Together with H2bc1 gene they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis, oocytes and zygotes) [padavattan_structural_2015]. Disruption of Th2a and Th2b genes causes defects in spermatogenesis [shinagawa_disruption_2015]. H2ac1 and H2bc1 contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization [shinagawa_histone_2014]. These variant facilitate OSKM-induced cell reprogramming [shinagawa_histone_2014].  X-ray structure of nucleosome harboring this variant have fewer histone-DNA contacts and perturbed L1-L1-loop interactions. Mutational in vivo analysis suggest histone tails and L1 loop are important for reprogramming[padavattan_structural_2015]. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that the H2ac1/H2bc1 complex was more stable than other combinations of canonical histones [shinagawa_histone_2014]. This variant is related to cH2A.1_(Homo_sapiens) encoded by H2A1C gene, is located in the same position at the largest histone gene cluster, however, their sequence differs at 18 positions. Note: Since this variant manifests similar features in mice and humans (tissue-specific expression, synteny, divergent sequence with respect to other canonical variants in each species) likely similar variants exist in all supraprimates or in higher taxa. Once and if sufficient evidence accumulates such variants may be grouped into a separate class.",

The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017].",

Humans have 18 H2A genes that code for replication-dependent H2A histones. The cluster on chromosome 6 encodes 13 H2A genes (H2AC1, H2AC4, H2AC6, H2AC7, H2AC8, H2AC11, H2AC12, H2AC13, H2AC14, H2AC15, H2AC16, H2AC17) and several pseudogenes. The first cluster on chromosome 1 encodes 4 genes (H2AC18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21), and the second cluster on chromosome 1 endodes one gene (H2AC25). 18 genes enconde 11 protein variants. H2A18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21 encode isoforms that have a methionine instead of leucine at position 51 conferring a mobility shift in triton-acid urea gel electrophoresis (historically, H2A.2 symbol was used to mark this difference) [franklin_non-allelic_1977]. H2AC1 gene (formely, called HIST1H2AA, TH2A) is the most divergent gene of the family, together with H2BC1 they share a common promoter and maifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) [huynh_two_2016].",

Like cH2A, this is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2B histone proteins that are expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD) or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2B histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of cH2Bs during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution  in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2B.E isoforms in mouse), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2Bs which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case.

This is the most divergent gene of the family (around 85% identity with other cH2Bs) [zalensky_human_2002]. Its length is also one amino acid longer than for the rest of H2Bs (126 amio acid residues after initiator methionine cleavage). Together with H2AC1 they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) (see human protein atlas).  H2AC1 and H2BC1 are thought to be maternal effect factors and their expression was shown to enhance OSKM-induced cell reprogramming in human cells [huynh_two_2016]. See also description of cH2B.1_(Mus_musculus)  a related histone variant encoded by H2bc1 gene which has been characterized through a number of in vivo and in vitro studies.

                "summary": "cH2B.1_(Mus_musculus)  is an isoform (variant) of clustered (canonical) H2B histones in mouse endoded by H2bc1 gene (formerly, Hist1h2ba, Th2b). This is the most divergent gene of the family, its protein product has differences in INSERT HERE. Together with H2ac1 gene they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis, oocytes and zygotes) [padavattan_structural_2015]. Disruption of Th2a and Th2b genes causes defects in spermatogenesis [shinagawa_disruption_2015]. H2ac1 and H2bc1 contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization [shinagawa_histone_2014]. These variant facilitate OSKM-induced cell reprogramming [shinagawa_histone_2014].  X-ray structure of nucleosome harboring this variant have fewer histone-DNA contacts and perturbed L1-L1-loop interactions. Mutational in vivo analysis suggest histone tails and L1 loop of cH2A.1 are important for reprogramming [padavattan_structural_2015]. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that the H2ac1/H2bc1 complex was more stable than other combinations of canonical histones [shinagawa_histone_2014]. This variant is related to cH2B.1_(Homo_sapiens) encoded by H2B1C gene, is located in the same position at the largest histone gene cluster, however, their sequence differs at INSERT HERE positions. Structural and in vitro studies suggest that cH2B.1-containing nucleosomes are less stable than RC H2B, which may allow H2B.1 to facilitate histone-protamine exchange during spermatogenesis. More recently, H2B.1 has also been detected in mouse oocytes, where its function is not yet understood [raman_novel_2022]. Note: Since this variant manifests similar features in mice and humans (tissue-specific expression, synteny, divergent sequence with respect to other canonical variants in each species) likely similar variants exist in all supraprimates or in higher taxa. Once and if sufficient evidence accumulates such variants may be grouped into a separate class.",

The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017].",

Humans have 19 H2B genes that code for replication-dependent H2B histones. The cluster on chromosome 6 encodes 15 H2B genes (H2BC1, H2BC3-H2BC15, H2BC17) and several pseudogenes. The first cluster on chromosome 1 encodes 2 genes (H2BC18, H2BC21) and two pseudogenes (H2BC19P, H2BC20P), and the second cluster on chromosome 1 endodes one gene (H2BC26) and one pseudogene (H2BC27P). One additional gene H2BC12L is represented by a human-specific duplication of the H2BC12 gene from the chromosome 6 onto chromosome 21, the gene appears to be expressed, its protein sequence is expected to have two nonsynonymous substitutions with respect to H2BC12 gene. 19 cH2B genes in human enconde 15 protein variants.

Currently, this is a loosely defined group of replication-dependent H2B histones in plants together with similar sequences that might have further diversified towards replication-independent tissue-specific expression but have not yet been extensively studied. An example of the latter would be the HTB3 gene of Arabidopsis which has the hallmarks of a replacement histone variant enriched in mature cells [jiang_evolution_2020]. Organisation of canonical histones in green plants is variable. In land plants unlike clustered/canonical histones of animals (see cH2B_(Metazoa)) replication dependent histone mRNAs are polyadenilated and genes are interspersed throught the genome. In chlorophyte green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, genes are grouped in clusteres and mRNAs end in 3'-stem loop similar to those of histone genes in animals [marzluff_metabolism_2008, alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Plant H2Bs vary substantially in the length and sequence of their N-terminal tails [jiang_evolution_2020,bergmuller_characterization_2007]. A study of evolution and functional divergence of H2B histones in plants by Jiang et al. concluded that amongst flowering plants, eudicots had experienced the highest degree of divergence among H2B genes [jiang_evolution_2020]. This divergence appears to have been driven by preferential expression during gametogenesis, including three genes in Arabidopsis (HTB7/8/10 genes) and at least one in tomato. While HTB8 gene in Arabidopsis belongs to a phylogenetically distinct H2B.S variant [jiang_evolution_2020], HTB7 and HTB10 are much more similar in sequence to other H2Bs for now are included as cH2B in our classification [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].",

                "summary": "cH3  canonical H3 histones. This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H3 histone proteins that are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD), replication coupled (RC), clustered or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H3 histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of canonical histones during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. Canonical histone genes are often present as large mulrigene families clustered together in certain locations of the genome. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution  in some species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Such diversification for cH3s is rather limited compared to cH2As and cH2Bs. In humans there are only two very similar cH3 isoforms both expressed in S-phase (cH3.1 and cH3.2). However, the mamal-specific H3.4 variant, which manifests tissue specific expression, is in fact a very closely related to the canonical H3s (similarly to cH2A.1 and cH2B.1 is is located within histone gene clusters and has mRNA with a stem-loop). In plants, some cH3s show variable expression patterns [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Another complication with defining cH3 class is that major H3 variants, such as H3.3, may only have 3-4 amino acid deference with the canonical H3 histone. They may have arisen multiple times during evolution and hence their functional classification does not match the phylogenetic classificstion. Ascomycetes are thought to have lost cH3 genes and generally have only a single form which is H3.3-like, it is usually referred to simply as H3 [talbert_unified_2012, malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH3 class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. ",

This is a loosely defined group of replication-dependent H3 histones in plants together with similar sequences that might have further diversified towards replication-independent tissue-specific expression but have not yet been extensively studied. Currenly not much is known about the functional specialization of various cH3s isoforms in plants [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. The canonical histone H3 or cH3.1 from higher plants is remarkably similar to that of animals, fungi, and even lower eukaryotes. A sequence comparison indicates that only four amino acid substitutions, F41Y, K53R, A90M, and A96C, differentiate the canonical histone H3 from plants and mammals. Interestingly, the five HTR genes from Arabidopsis encoding histone H3.1 do not contain introns and are expressed in tissues containing highly dividing cells and all but one are expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle. In a similar way, the seven genes encoding H3.1 from rice also lack introns and several of them are expressed in highly dividing tissues [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Organisation of canonical histones in green plants is variable. In land plants unlike clustered/canonical histones of animals (see cH3_(Metazoa)) replication dependent histone mRNAs are polyadenilated and genes are interspersed throught the genome. In chlorophyte green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, genes are grouped in clusteres and mRNAs end in 3'-stem loop similar to those of histone genes in animals [marzluff_metabolism_2008, alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].

                "summary": "CS_H2B_(Echinoidea) is a histone variant class containing cleavage-stage (CS) H2B histones characterized so far in sea urchins. Four classes of histones in sea urchins have been characterized. Three sets of histone variants are coexisting in the embryo at larval stages of sea urchin\u2019s development: the maternally inherited cleavage stage variants (CS) expressed during the two initial cleavage divisions, the early histone variants, which are recruited into embryonic chromatin from middle cleavage stages until hatching and the late variants, that are fundamentally expressed from blastula stage onward [oliver_conservative_2003]. The fourth class of histones in sea urchins are the sperm histones. They are exclusively transcribed during spermatogenesis and code for specialized H1 and H2B proteins with basic N-terminal extensions which are responsible for the unusually high chromatin condensation in mature sperm [mandl_five_1997]. Early, late, and sperm histone genes lack introns, contain the conserved 3-prime terminal stem-loop structure instead of a poly(A) addition site, and thus show the classical hallmarks of replication-dependent histone genes. The CS proteins are the first histones to be synthesized after fertilization in the cleaving embryo. The CS histones appear to be synthesized during oogenesis and in the mature egg, where they give rise to a large maternal pool of histone proteins. The CS proteins are the only histones present in the chromatin of the egg and zygote up to the second cell division. Thereafter, the efficient synthesis of the early histones leads to a rapid dilution of the CS histones in the chromatin except in the nondividing small micromeres, where the CS proteins remain the major histones up to the pluteus larva stage. The maternally stored CS histones play an important role in remodeling of the sperm chromatin after fertilization. Upon entry in the egg cytoplasm, the sperm H1 and H2B proteins present in the male pronucleus are rapidly phosphorylated on their N-terminal extensions, and the sperm H1 protein is subsequently replaced in the chromatin by the CS H1 protein. This exchange of H1 histones is immediately followed by decondensation of the chromatin. At around the time of DNA replication, the CS H2A and H2B proteins start to accumulate in the chromatin of the male pronucleus, which correlates with the transition of the nucleosomal repeat length from 250 bp in the sperm chromatin to 200 bp in the early embryo. As a consequence of this massive chromatin restructuring, the paternal genome is transcriptionally activated already at the beginning of S phase in the first cell cycle, which further emphasizes the importance of the CS histones for early development [mandl_five_1997].",

Four classes of histones in sea urchins have been characterized. Three sets of histone variants are coexisting in the embryo at larval stages of sea urchin\u2019s development: the maternally inherited cleavage stage variants (CS) expressed during the two initial cleavage divisions, the early histone variants, which are recruited into embryonic chromatin from middle cleavage stages until hatching and the late variants, that are fundamentally expressed from blastula stage onward [oliver_conservative_2003]. The fourth class of histones in sea urchins are the sperm histones [mandl_five_1997]. Early, late, and sperm histone genes lack introns, contain the conserved 3-prime terminal stem-loop structure instead of a poly(A) addition site, and thus show the classical hallmarks of replication-dependent histone genes. The repetitive early histone genes are transcriptionally activated upon meiotic maturation of the egg, are maximally expressed in the rapidly dividing blastula embryo, and are already silenced at the hatching blastula stage, when the transcripts of late histone genes start to accumulate [mandl_five_1997].",

Two H2A-H2B dimers in turn associate with H3-H4 tetramer to form complete nucleosome core. Structure of H2A consists of a histone fold domain extended by a short \u03b1C-helix and has both N- and C-terminal tails. \u03b1C-helix and C-terminal tail form \"docking domain\" that locks the H2A-H2B dimer onto the surface of H3-H4 tetramer [luger_crystal_1997]. It has been suggested that H2A and H2B have arisen from H3 and H4 during evolution [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. H2A histones have the most number of described functional variants.",

The H2AL1Q and H2AL3 genes have unusually long extensions at their 3'-ends and have not so far been detected at protein level. Mouse genome has a leneage specific expansion of H2A.L genes, encoding a total of 18 genes (15 genes on X chromosome H2a1a-H2a1o and H2al3; two genes on Y-chromosome H2al2c and H2al2b; one gene on chromosome 2 H2al2a) and two pseudogenes [molaro_evolutionary_2018].

This gene was first identified in [govin_pericentric_2007] (NCBI protein id NP_080903) and was refered to as H2AL2 or H2A.L.2 histone in the following papers. However, this gene is not located at the H2A.L.2 locus (as defined by Molaro et al.) on X-chromosome, but it is rather located on chromosome 2. A synthenic location of H2A.L.2 locus in mouse is occupied by H2al1m gene [Seal et al. unpublished].

These are encoded by H2al1a, H2al2a and H2ap genes, respectively. The H2Al2 endoded variant was later renamed in the literature as H2A.L.2 [jiang_short_2020]. The H2ap gencoded variant is in fact H2A.P in the current nomenclature. Alternatively, Molaro et al. have named three evolutionary conserved loci on X chromosome that harbor H2A.L genes, these loci are H2A.L.1, H2A.L.2 and H2A.L.3 [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. While human gene and variant naming is in line with the names of these loci, in mouse names of these loci do not correspond exactly to the originally proposed gene names except for H2A.L.3 locus which harbors H2al3 gene (not H2ap gene(!)). In mouse at H2A.L.1 locus a pseudogene H2al1q-ps is located, at H2A.L.2 locus mouse has H2al1m gene (H2al1a-H2al1o genes located within 5 megabases from this locus have similar protein sequences(?)), while H2A.L.2 variant encoded by H2al2a is located on chromosome 2 (two similar genes H2al2b and H2al2c are located on Y chromosome). In this classification we follow the numbering used in gene names which also corresponds to the one established earlier in the literature. Hence, H2A.L.2 variant in mouse encompasses H2al2a gene and similar H2al2b and H2al2c genes, while H2A.L.1 variant encompasses 14 H2al1a-H2al1o genes including H2al1m gene located at a syntenic location of the H2A.L.2 locus.",

                "summary": "H2A.R - is a histone variant found currently in monotremes and marsupials, it is an intermediate between the eutherian short histone H2A variants and canonical H2A. Evolutionary analysis suggests that ancestor histone H2A variant branched out to H2A.R (still possessing a C-terminus) in monotremes and marsupials, and to the four classes of the short histone H2A variants in eutherian mammals. H2A.R histone variants have variable N-terminus, altered charge of the histone fold domain, divergent L1-loop, altered acidic patch and extended C-terminal tail. Platypus and opossum H2A.R variants are expressed in the testis but not in other tissues we examined, including opossum ovary. Molaro et al. concluded that expression analysis allows to infer that testis-specific expression preceded the divergence of H2A.R and eutherian short histone H2A variants and is a common feature of all these genes. It is currently unclear whether the common ancestor of H2A.R and the short H2As was autosomal or sex chromosome-linked [molaro_evolutionary_2018].",

                "summary": "H2A.W_(Magnoliopsida) is a plant specific variant found in angiosperms (flowering plants) having a potentially DNA minor-groove-binding SPKK (sometime reffered to as KSPKKA) motif within its C-terminal tail, it is enriched in heterochromatin and implicated in gene silencing and DNA damage response.",
                "taxonomy": "H2A.W variant is found exclusively in angiosperms [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].",
                "genes": "Arabidopsis has three H2A.W genes (HTA6, HTA7, and HTA12) endoding three isoforms, rice genome has four genes (HTA701, HTA706, HTA707, and HTA710) encoding three isoforms. Isoforms endoded by different genes may have different number of SPKK motifs. A single copy of the SPKK motif seems to be true for all eudicots, whereas the monocots have been shown to possess 2 or even 3 copies of the same motif [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,kawashima_diversification_2015].",
                "evolution": "H2A.W is a plant-lineage-specific variant that may have arisen early in the evolution of spermatophytes or seed plants. H2A.W lacks homologs in unicellular green algae, liverworts, mosses, and lycophytes but has distinctive homologs in early spermatophytes from the genus Ginkgo, Cycas, and Gnetum [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,kawashima_diversification_2015]. Instead of H2A.W homologs, Kawashima et al. identified a novel group of related H2A variants, they named H2A.M, in the genomes of liverworts, mosses, and lycophytes [kawashima_diversification_2015]. Whether H2A.M and H2A.W emerged from the same ancestor or H2A.M in early basal land plants evolved gradually to become H2A.W in seed plants remains undetermined [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,kawashima_diversification_2015].",
                "expression": "In Arabidopsis HTA6 and HTA7 were found to have S-phase specific expression during the cell cycle, while H2A12 did not manifest any specific cell-cycle expression peak [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,menges_genome-wide_2003].",
                "knock-out": "In Arabidopsis single mutants of H2A.W genes do not dispay any phenotype; double mutants, HtA6 HTA7 and HTA6 HTA12, and triple mutants result in growth defects that were even more severe in the triple mutant. This suggests that the three H2A.W paralogs in Arabidopsis are functionally redundant [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,yelagandula_histone_2014]. HTA7 knock-out in Arabidopsis results in sensitivity to genotoxic agents [lorkovic_compartmentalization_2017].",
                "function": "H2A.W participates in constitutive heterochromatin formation, particularly pericentric heterochromatin [yelagandula_histone_2014]. H2A.W.7 (HTA7 gene) in Arabidopsis was shown to be involved in DNA damage response. It contains an SQ motif within C-terminal tail, which is phosphorylated by ATM kinase upon DNA damage [lorkovic_compartmentalization_2017].",
                "sequence": "A characteristic feature of H2A.W sequences is the presence of one or multiple SPKK motifs within its long C-terminal tail. The SPKK motif was reported to preferentially bind AT-rich DNA, which is a feature of pericentric heterochromatin occupied by H2A.W in Arabidopsis [churchill_spkk_1989]. H2A.W variants also have significant sequence alerations within L1-loop and docking domain, which influence nucleosome stability [osakabe_histone_2018]. L1-loop of flowering plants contains (RYA/SK/Q) motif [kawashima_diversification_2015].",
                "localization": "Genome-wide analysis showed that H2A.W variants localize with heterochromatin, transposable elements, H3K9me2-rich regions [yelagandula_histone_2014].",
                "deposition": "Specific deposition mechanism are not known. Certain H2A.W are desposited during S-phase in a replication-dependent manner, while others manifest replication-independent deposition [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].",
                "structure": "The extended C-terminal tail of H2A.W interacts with linker DNA and protects DNA from the cleavage by MNase [osakabe_histone_2018]. H2A.W may facilitate heterochromatin formation by promoting long-range interactions between nucleosomes, an activity that requires the long C-terminal tail domain containing a SPKK motif [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019,yelagandula_histone_2014]. Replacement of H2A.W L1-loop with the corresponding sequence from H2A does not affect nucleosome stability [osakabe_histone_2018].",

It is also more broadly implicated in chromatin remodeling, found at collapsed replication forks and heterochromatin. It is a non-monophyletic (polyphyletic) variant  of H2A and has the charactristic SQE/D\u03a6 motif at C-terminus (SQAY in Drosophila), where \u03a6-represents a hydrophobic residue (usually Tyr in mammals), and S is phosphorylation site. In multicellular eukaryotes H2A.X is usually closely related to  cH2As in the same group of multicellular organisms [millar_organizing_2013, talbert_histone_2021]. It seems likely that H2A.X was ancestral to cH2As due to its conserved role in DNA damage response [talbert_histone_2010]. Caveats: Nematodes are the only known species that lack H2A.X. Many fungi lack canonical H2A its role is fullfiled by H2A.X. In Drosophila melanogaster H2A.X function is fullfiled by H2A.Z histone.",

                "summary": "H2A.Z  is a replication-independent H2A histone variant strongly conserved in almost all Eukaryotes (exceptions may include some  metamonads (e.g. Giardia, Trichomonas), Amebae and parasitic fungi [dalmasso_canonical_2011]). This histone variant is essential from Tetrahymena to mammals (although its knock out in yeast is not lethal) and amounts to around 5-10% of H2A histones [dalmasso_canonical_2011]. H2A.Z containing nucleosomes often localize near transcription start sites (+1 nucleosomes) and enhancer regions, they are thought to be involved in Pol II recruitment, transcription regulation, DNA repair, suppression of antisense RNA, heterochromatin regulation.  [giaimo_histone_2019]. H2A.Z nucleosomes have a larger acidic patch, an amino acid insertion in \u03b11-helix and one deletion in the docking domain compared to the canonical H2A. The L1-loop region exhibits four amino acids difference between H2A.Z and canonical H2A and is likely involved in conferring stability and functional specificity of variant nucleosomes via L1-L1 interactions [shaytan_nucleosome_2015]. C-terminal region of the yeast H2A.Z protein interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), promoting its recruitment at promoters [adam_h2az_2001].",

It has been suggested that H2A and H2B have arisen from H3 and H4 during evolution [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Structure of H2B consists of a histone fold with a long flexible N-terminal tail which protrudes between the DNA gyres. H2B interacts with H4 in the nucleosome core via a four helix bundle motif. Addtional \u03b1C-helix of H2B decorates the surface of nucleosome. Unlike, H3 and H2A histone, H2B histones have relatively modest number of characterized histone variants. Although in plants, histone H2Bs have undergone significant sequence divergence and expansion in the number of encoding genes [jiang_evolution_2020].",

It has a long extended N-terminal tail, has about 45% amino acid sequence identity and 70% similarity with both the major somatic H2Bs [churikov_novel_2004]. First, characterized in human as H2BFWT gene (now called H2BW1 gene). In mouse a paralog of H2B.W variant was initially identified by Govin et al. and named H2BL2 [govin_pericentric_2007]. In human beings, unlike other mammals including the mouse, core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) are not displaced completely during spermiogenesis and account for approximately 15% of the basic chromosomal proteins within the mature sperm [lee_functional_2009]. At least human H2B.W can replace conventional histone H2B in the nucleosome, does not affect the overall structure and stability of the nucleosome [boulard_nh2_2006]. In contrast to conventional H2B, H2B.W was unable to recruit chromosome condensation factors and to participate in the assembly of mitotic chromosomes, this fact is attibuted to its highly divergent NH2 tail [boulard_nh2_2006].",

Other mammals have different numbers of H2BW paralogs (between 1 and 4) but these are all located at the same conserved location of the X chromosome [Ruth et al].

Strictly speaking, this is not convergent evolution because the H3.3 versions do not all have the same amino acid residues in these four positions. However, it strongly suggests that a similar constraint has led to these repeated origins of distinguishable H3 and H3.3 types [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Although, given the likelihood of independent divergences, H3.3 variants from different taxonomic clades may be neither more nor less orthologous to animal H3.3 than their cH3 ounterparts [talbert_unified_2012]. Replication-independent and replication-coupled H3 variants within an organism typically differ in residue 31 (and whether it can be phosphorylated) as well as residues 86?? and 89, but distinguishing residues vary in different organisms and caution is advised in designating H3.3 in less wellstudied eukaryotic kingdoms [talbert_unified_2012].",

H3.3 is characterized by changes at four positions with respect to cH3s, one in the N-terminal tail and three in the alpha-2-helix of the histone fold domain (positions 31,86,89,90). The sequence differences within the alpha-2-helix alow H3.3 to interact specifically with its own chaperones (HIRA, ATRX, DAXX). At position 31 H3.3s instead of alanine have serine or threonine which can be phosphorilated. There are multiple studies showing that phosphorylation of this site is functionally important [talbert_unified_2012]. Particularly, H3.3S31ph is associated with H3.3K27 acetylation which helps gene activation and was shown to be essential for gastrulation in Xenopus [sitbon_histone_2020]. The metazoan histone H3.3 has been most closely associated with active transcription, replacing cH3s at active genes and promoters, implicated in diverse biological processes, including development, transcriptional memory and transcriptional reprogramming. However, genetic studies highlighted also its imortance in maintaining heterochromatin at telomeres, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions [jang_histone_2015], as well as revealed essential functions of H3.3 in the germline and early embryonic development [elsaesser_new_2010,yuen_histone_2014,jang_histone_2015].",

At the cellular level, H3.3 loss triggers cell cycle suppression and cell death. Surprisingly, H3.3 depletion does not dramatically disrupt gene regulation in the developing embryo. Instead, H3.3 depletion causes dysfunction of heterochromatin structures at telomeres, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, leading to mitotic defects [jang_histone_2015]. In C. elegans Despite these specific expression patterns, we find that neither loss of individual H3.3 homologs nor the knockout of all five H3.3-coding genes causes sterility or lethality. However, we demonstrate an essential role for the conserved histone chaperone HIRA in the nucleosomal loading of all H3.3 variants. This requirement can be bypassed by mutation of the H3.3-specific residues to those found in H3. While even removal of all H3.3 homologs does not result in lethality, it leads to reduced fertility and viability in response to high-temperature stress [delaney_differential_2018]. Flies that lack both H3.3 genes have reduced viability and individuals that survive to adulthood are completely sterile in both sexes [sakai_transcriptional_2009]. Targeted disruption of one gene (H3f3b) results in a number of phenotypic abnormalities, including a reduction in H3.3 histone levels, leading to male infertility, as well as abnormal sperm and testes morphology. Additionally, null germ cell populations at specific stages in spermatogenesis, in particular spermatocytes and spermatogonia, exhibited increased rates of apoptosis. Disruption of H3f3b also altered histone post-translational modifications and gene expression in the testes, with the most prominent changes occurring at genes involved in spermatogenesis. Finally, H3f3b null testes also exhibited abnormal germ cell chromatin reorganization and reduced protamine incorporation [yuen_histone_2014].",

H3.3 is also essential for germ line development in mammals, where it is required for the remodeling of both maternal and paternal gametes [delaney_differential_2018]. Its role in histone replacement at active genes and promoters is highly conserved and has been proposed to participate in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states [szenker_double_2011].

While the majority of nucleosomes are replaced by protamines during mammalian spermatogenesis, some H3.3 nucleosomes are retained and may transmit epigenetic information to the zygote [delaney_differential_2018]. In embryonic stem cells for example, HIRA chaperones H3.3 to both active and repressed genes, including also bivalent promoters normally repressed in embryonic stem cells. This highlights a role of HIRA in establishing chromatin landscapes not always related to active chromatin but key to allow proper differentiation [otero_histone_2014].",

Well characterized oncomutations in H3.3 genes include K27M, G34W/L in pediatric high-grade gliomas and K36M and G34V/R in bone tumors [xiong_histone_2016]. Competing models have suggested that H3K27M oncohistones sequester or poison  PRC2 complex which deposits H3K27me3 marks. However, Sarthy et al. demonstrated that the K27M epitope only inhibits H3K27 trimethylation on chromatin in vivo, supporting the idea that these oncohistones inhibit chromatin-bound PRC2 complexes. A possible mechanism comes from recent reports [lee_automethylation_2019,wang_regulation_2019] showing that EZH2 (key component of PRC2) methylates  itself, and that this automethylation is required for full catalytic activity. These studies also showed that H3K27M blocks EZH2 automethylation, and might contribute to the dominant effect of H3K27M mutations [sarthy_histone_2020].",

While H3.3 in Ascomycetes is the only form of H3 histone it is mainly reffered to as H3 rather than H3.3. In the current classification we will refer to such histones as H3.3_(Ascomycota) to retain its proper placement within our classification. Basidiomycetes have both canonical H3 and H3.3 histones. Fungi H3.3 along with plant and animal H3.3s have evolved independently, but share similar sequence difference with respective canonical H3s. It is likely that they have evolved under similar contraints. Since H3.3 as a separate variant is available only in Basidiomycetes the H3.3/cH3 functional difference in Fungi remains poorly studied. Anju et al. have charaterized two H3 genes in basidiomycete Ustilago maydis U1 and U2.

Despite having the same name as H3.3 of animals, similar functions and key amino acids differences with repective canonical H3s, plant H3.3 has evolved independently. However, this strongly suggests that a similar constraint has led to these repeated origins of distinguishable H3 and H3.3 types [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. H3.3  in plants is characterized by changes at four positions with respect to cH3s, two in the N-terminal tail and two in the alpha-2-helix of the histone fold domain (positions 31, 41, 87, 90, compare with positions 31,87,89,90 in animals). At position 31 H3.3s  in plants instead of alanine usially have threonine which can be phosphorilated [talbert_unified_2012]. H3.3 is likely involved in transcriptional regulation, is enriched in the body of actively transcribed genes, promoters and downstream of transcription termination sites in some genes [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Certain mechanisms of H3.3 action have been reported. Jacob et al. have shown that SET domain of the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methyltransferase ATXR5 have a bipartite catalytic domain that specifically reads alanine-31 of H3.1. Thus variation at position 31 between H3.1 and replication-independent H3.3 is responsible for inhibiting the activity of ATXR5 and its paralog, ATXR6 [jacob_selective_2014]. Wollmann et al. proposed that H3.3 prevents recruitment of H1, inhibiting H1\u2019s promotion of chromatin folding that restricts access to DNA methyltransferases responsible for gene body methylation. Thus, gene body methylation is likely shaped by H3.3 dynamics in conjunction with transcriptional activity [wollmann_histone_2017].",

This variant is also reffered to as H3.1t, H3T, or TS H3.4. The H3.4 variant is very similar to canonical H3 histones both in sequence, gene location and transcriptional regulation. In human H3.4 has only 4 amino acid difference from cH3s (A23V,V71M, A98S, A111V), its gene is located within histone gene cluster, is intronless, its mRNA has a stem-loop structure. H3.4 expression is  replication-dependent [ueda_testis-specific_2017]. Mouse H3.4 was shown to be essential for very early stages of spermatogenesis, its deficiency leads to azoospermia because of the loss of haploid germ cells. When differentiating spermatogonia emerge in normal spermatogenesis, H3.4 appears and replaces the canonical H3 proteins [ueda_testis-specific_2017]. Structural studies have revealed that H3.4 containing nucleosome are less stable, particularly due to V71M and A111V substitutions [tachiwana_structural_2010]. Tachiwana et al. have found that H3.4/H4 is not efficiently incorporated into the nucleosome by human Nap1 chaperone, due to its defective H3.4/H4 deposition on DNA. In contrast, human Nap2 chaperone, a paralog of Nap1, promoted nucleosome assembly with H3.4/H4. Mutational analyses revealed that the A111V mutation in H3.4 is essential for this difference [tachiwana_nucleosome_2008]. It was demostrated that A23V mutation favors the interaction of trymethyllysine-binding Tudor domains of PHF1 and PHF2 proteins (critical components of the PCR2 complex) with H3K27me3 marks. PHF1 co-localizes with H3.4 in testis and its Tudor domain preferentially binds to H3.4K27me3 over canonical H3K27me3 in vitro, implicating that H3.4K27me3 might be a physiological ligand of PHF1/19.

Although H3.V associated with the mitotic spindle and enriched at telomeres it is not essential for mini-chromosome segregation, telomere maintenance or transcriptional silencing at the telomere-proximal expression sites [lowell_variant_2004,  anderson_kinetoplastid-specific_2013]. While the general structure of H3.V resembles that of CenH3, it does not possess the specific sequence features required to be classified as a CenH3 variant [lowell_variant_2004]. H3.V plays a critical role in the regulation of antigenic variation. Together with H4.V they are involved in the positioning and expression of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes, which the parasite Trypanosoma brucei switches to avoid immune detection [muller_genome_2018, schulz_base_2016]. H3.V is important for transcription termination and expression of downstream genes. The trypanosomatid-specific hyper-modified DNA base J  and H3.V collaboratively influence the termination process resulting in read-through transcription and increased expression of downstream genes [siegel_four_2009, reynolds_histone_2016, schulz_base_2016, mcdonald_localization_2022].",

Three sets of histone variants are coexisting in the embryo at larval stages of sea urchin\u2019s development: the maternally inherited cleavage stage variants (CS) expressed during the two initial cleavage divisions, the early histone variants, which are recruited into embryonic chromatin from middle cleavage stages until hatching and the late variants, that are fundamentally expressed from blastula stage onward [oliver_conservative_2003]. The fourth class of histones in sea urchins are the sperm histones [mandl_five_1997]. Early, late, and sperm histone genes lack introns, contain the conserved 3-prime terminal stem-loop structure instead of a poly(A) addition site, and thus show the classical hallmarks of replication-dependent histone genes. The repetitive early histone genes are transcriptionally activated upon meiotic maturation of the egg, are maximally expressed in the rapidly dividing blastula embryo, and are already silenced at the hatching blastula stage, when the transcripts of late histone genes start to accumulate [mandl_five_1997]. Late genes are active from the late blastula stage onward [maxson_evolution_1987].",

The repertoires of short histone H2A variants vary extensively among eutherian mammals due to lineage-specific gains and losses. Short H2A variants include H2A.B, H2A.L, H2A.P, H2A.Q, their genes are usually located on X chromosome and are intronless. These four clades of eutherian mammal short H2A variants emerged from a single, well-supported monophyletic clade, confirming their common ancestry [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Due to shortened docking domain and changes within the acidic patch nucleosomes incorporating short H2As wrap less DNA (120-130 bp) and form loosely packed chromatin. There are few conserved residues in the histone fold domain of sH2As that distinguish them from each other, instead much of their specialization may stem from changes in the N- and C-terminal tails of these variatns [molaro_evolutionary_2018].  Abberant short H2A upregulation was reported in a broad range of cancers [chew_short_2021].",

Four classes of histones in sea urchins have been characterized. Three sets of histone variants are coexisting in the embryo at larval stages of sea urchin\u2019s development: the maternally inherited cleavage stage variants (CS) expressed during the two initial cleavage divisions, the early histone variants, which are recruited into embryonic chromatin from middle cleavage stages until hatching and the late variants, that are fundamentally expressed from blastula stage onward [oliver_conservative_2003]. The fourth class of histones in sea urchins are the sperm histones. They are exclusively transcribed during spermatogenesis and code for specialized H1 and H2B proteins with basic N-terminal extensions which are responsible for the unusually high chromatin condensation in mature sperm [mandl_five_1997]. In parechinus angulosus the characterized sperm H2B sequence has a repeating pentapeptide in the N-terminal region [strickland_complete_1978].",
