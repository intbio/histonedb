This dir contains the main information for creation od histoneDB -the seed alignmengs.
Structure and format are strict:
subdirnames and filenames - exactly match histone types and variant names.
The format of seq headers also is strict: >tax_name|gi_number|.... description...

If no gi is available: NOGI_unique_number

Bad format will crash the database creation.


----
In top dir - are combined seed alignments for histone types,
these are only for vizualization on web-site,
not used for database classification.
